Hi,
We worked on the extra credit portion of the adversarial project and we think our findings are pretty cool!
Here is how to run the notebook, it's in a google colab so you shouldn't have to install anything extra. Here is the link:

Let us know what you think and if you have any feedback. Please don't hesitate to contact any of us with any questions or problems if this isn't working as it should. 
Thank you for an awesome semester!
Best,  
Matteo, Joel, and Arjun
