Hi!

In order to explore the material in more depth, we decided to visualize how a Cifar10 ResNet34 model responds to adversarial attacks. We think our findings are pretty cool!

In order to run the notebok please visit the google colab link:

Let us know what you think and if you have any feedback. Please don't hesitate to contact any of us with any questions or problems if this isn't working as it should. 

Thank you for an awesome semester!

Best,  
Matteo, Joel, and Arjun
